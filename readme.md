Small code along from Jonas Schmedtmann's JS course.

This is small app that contains my first AJAX call. I added feature so the user can chose what country is displayed.

Please write the name of the country to see this country details displayed on the card.

You can see the site live [here](https://axseinga.github.io/cards-countries/)
